# 6502-Emulator
Android 6502 Processor Emulator with game console

This is an orignal verison of my app: Learn assembly language on Google play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redlee90.learn6502assembly).
Since I uploaded this project, the play store version has evoloved tremendously. However, I haven't decided to make that app open source. This one is outdated, but
outline my design cues and choices. Please feel free to resue any portion of the code. You don't need my permission to do that.
